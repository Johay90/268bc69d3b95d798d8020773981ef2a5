- Crusher bug fixes

- Added how we bank our money when not buying bullets (simplified it)

- Added hide button. This will only be in effect until a refresh.

- Fixed a bug with the GUI. It would create a new element every second. This should help browser performance.

- Fixed a bug with crusher where it would bug out if you had tuned cars at the top (basically had a wrong condition in our crusher loop, before we looped the "amount of cars you can crush" while we should be looping all the cars). Very simple mistake by me.

- Lots of other bug fixes

- GUI with lots of config options
